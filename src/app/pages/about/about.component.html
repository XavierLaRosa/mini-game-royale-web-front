                    Mini Game Royale is a platform to play simple and short games with friends.
                    This game is a Christmas gift to my girlfriend as she loves to play games like Categories. 
                    There are many characters to choose from like mochi, detective mochi, strawberry queen and much much more!
                    Every game won earns you points which will eventually be used with a store that is in development. The store will 
                    allow users to unlock more characters!
